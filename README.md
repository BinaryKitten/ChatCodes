# ChatCodes
#### Now with 20% more Alpha

> Forked from the amazing [JitterTed's](https://github.com/jitterted) JitterChat ❤️

## Usage

- Download the latest alpha from the releases tab
- Use "Install plugin from disk" to install the plugin
- Restart your IDE as applicable
- Open your settings pane, and add your [Twitch oAuth Token](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) and Username to
the correct fields
- Restart your IDE (I know we'll have an open ticket for that soon)
- Open the ChatCodes pane in bottom right of IDE and hope it connects

A working version but with everything turned on:

USE WITH CAUTION as chat can use the following commands without mercy.

- `!line <linenumber>` to move your caret to that line (alias !l)
- `!comment <linenumber> <comment>` to add a comment above that line (alias !c)
- `!tooltip <linenumber> <tooltip>` to add a not intrusive tooltip to that line (alias !t)

You can clear all tooltips using the "Clear ChatCodes Comments" action that can be invoked by search everywhere

So much is broken or wrong but it *should* work for alpha testing purposes
