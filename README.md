You can see an intro video about this project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-9GtV5rbuI

## To Do

* Make the comment view really a tree
  * Separate comments based on the file
  * Dynamically update comment count for file node
* Implement action for "connect to Twitch" <-> "disconnect from Twitch" button toggle
* Add small text area for me to send chat messages out - but I need to be logged in as "jitterted"
